# Dead Rails - Defold Game Development Log

## Project Overview
A simple zombie chase game built in Defold 1.10.0 for learning purposes. Player moves around avoiding a zombie that chases them. Game over when caught, restart with R key.

## Current Working State

### Player Movement System
**BREAKTHROUGH**: We successfully implemented smooth diagonal movement using vector math with speed normalization!

#### Working Smooth Diagonal Movement (Current):
```lua
-- In player.script - SMOOTH DIAGONAL VERSION
function update(self, dt)
    if self.moving and (self.direction_x ~= 0 or self.direction_y ~= 0) then
        local pos = go.get_position()

        -- Calculate distance for normalization (like zombie does)
        local distance = math.sqrt(self.direction_x * self.direction_x + self.direction_y * self.direction_y)

        -- Move using normalized vector (like zombie approach)
        if distance > 0 then
            local move_x = (self.direction_x / distance) * self.speed * dt
            local move_y = (self.direction_y / distance) * self.speed * dt

            pos.x = pos.x + move_x
            pos.y = pos.y + move_y

            go.set_position(pos)
        end
    end
end
```

#### Diagonal Movement Solution:
**Key insight**: The zombie's vector math approach works perfectly for player movement too! The solution uses:
- Multi-key tracking with `keys_pressed` table ✅
- Vector math with speed normalization ✅
- Direction vectors (-1, 0, 1) for each axis ✅
- Smart animation selection based on primary movement direction ✅

### Game Components

#### Player (`Player.go` + `player.script`)
- **Speed**: 120 pixels/second (2x faster than zombie)
- **Movement**: Smooth vector-based movement with diagonal support
- **Animation**: Uses player.atlas with left/left-2, right/right-2, up, down images
- **Scale**: 30% of original size
- **Input**: Arrow keys + WASD (supports key combinations)
- **Smooth**: ✅ Works perfectly in all directions including diagonals

#### Zombie (`Zombie.go` + `zombie.script`)
- **Speed**: 60 pixels/second
- **Movement**: Smooth vector-based chasing using distance/direction math
- **Animation**: Uses zombie.atlas with zombie.png, zombie-1.png, zombie-2.png
- **Scale**: 30% of original size
- **AI**: Continuously chases player, stops when game over
- **Smooth**: ✅ Perfectly smooth movement

#### Game Over System
- **Trigger**: When zombie gets within 30 pixels of player
- **Visual**: Dark overlay sprite on screen + console messages
- **Behavior**: Stops both player and zombie movement
- **Restart**: R key restarts game, respawns zombie randomly

#### Input System
- **Movement**: Arrow keys or WASD
- **Restart**: R key (only works during game over)
- **Bindings**: Defined in `input/game.input_binding`

### Technical Discoveries

#### Movement Smoothness Solution ✅
**SOLVED**: Diagonal movement achieved using vector math with speed normalization!

**Working approach**: Vector math with proper implementation:
1. **Multi-key tracking** - Track all pressed keys in `keys_pressed` table
2. **Direction vectors** - Convert keys to -1/0/1 direction values
3. **Speed normalization** - Use `math.sqrt()` and division like zombie
4. **Smart animations** - Choose animation based on primary movement direction

**Previous failed attempts** were likely due to improper implementation details, not the fundamental approach.

#### Speed Tuning
- **Original**: Player 850 speed - smooth but too fast
- **Previous problem**: Lowering speed with old diagonal code introduced jerkiness
- **Current**: Player 120, Zombie 60 - perfect balance with new vector math movement

#### Animation System
- **Player**: Uses atlas with separate left/right animations (left.png + left-2.png, etc.)
- **Zombie**: Uses atlas with walking cycle (zombie.png, zombie-1.png, zombie-2.png)
- **Both**: 30% scale looks good on screen
- **Frame rates**: Player animations at 8fps, zombie at 6fps

#### Splash Screen System ✅
- **Implementation**: Collection factory approach
- **Image**: Custom splash.png (960x640) with "Dead Rails" title and red "Jugar" button
- **Button detection**: Click coordinates (190-365 x, 380-460 y)
- **Transition**: Hides splash, creates main game via factory, transfers input focus
- **Standalone**: No manual file changes or engine restart needed

#### Side-Scrolling System ✅
- **World Size**: 1920x640 (double screen width for scrolling)
- **Background**: Custom bg_2.png landscape (wheat fields with sky)
- **Camera**: Smooth following system that tracks player movement
- **Boundaries**: Player can move throughout world area, camera clamps at edges
- **Implementation**: View projection updates with camera position
- **Zombie spawning**: Uses full world width for spawn locations

### Game Settings
- **Resolution**: 960x640
- **Frame rate**: 60fps with vsync
- **Update frequency**: 60hz

### Known Issues

#### Minor Issues
- Game over text only shows in console, not on screen (overlay shows but no text)

### Platformer/Scroller Conversion Goals
**Current Status**: Successfully implemented side-scrolling camera system and world boundaries

**Next Phase - Convert to Platformer Game (TO DO LIST):**
1. **Add gravity system** - Player falls down unless on platform ⏳
2. **Add platforms/terrain** - Create jumpable platforms in the landscape ⏳
3. **Add jumping mechanics** - Spacebar/up arrow for jumping with physics ⏳
4. **Add collision system** - Platform collision detection and response ⏳
5. **Redesign zombie AI** - Make zombies follow platform rules or fly ⏳
6. **Add level progression** - Multiple areas or increasing difficulty ⏳
7. **Add collectibles** - Items to collect while avoiding zombies ⏳

**Preparation Tasks:**
- **Convert backgrounds to match game screen size (960x640)** - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Update spawn positions - Player at door center, zombie at far left** - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Add stage completion trigger - Player reaches right edge to win** - ✅ COMPLETED

**Polish Features (after platformer mechanics):**
1. **Add game over text display** - On-screen text instead of console
2. **Add sound effects** - Jump, landing, zombie sounds
3. **Add scoring system** - Points for survival time and collectibles
4. **Add particle effects** - Dust clouds, death effects
5. **Add power-ups** - Temporary speed boost, invincibility, etc.

### Code Snippets for Reference

#### Smooth Diagonal Movement Input System (WORKING)
```lua
-- Input handling with multi-key support
function on_input(self, action_id, action)
    if action_id == hash("up") then
        if action.pressed then
            self.keys_pressed["up"] = true
        elseif action.released then
            self.keys_pressed["up"] = false
        end
    -- ... similar for down, left, right
    end

    update_movement(self)
end

function update_movement(self)
    -- Calculate direction vector based on pressed keys
    self.direction_x = 0
    self.direction_y = 0

    if self.keys_pressed["up"] then self.direction_y = 1 end
    if self.keys_pressed["down"] then self.direction_y = -1 end
    if self.keys_pressed["left"] then self.direction_x = -1 end
    if self.keys_pressed["right"] then self.direction_x = 1 end

    -- Set movement and animation based on direction
    if self.direction_x ~= 0 or self.direction_y ~= 0 then
        self.moving = true
        -- Smart animation selection based on primary direction
        if math.abs(self.direction_x) > math.abs(self.direction_y) then
            play_animation(self, self.direction_x > 0 and "right" or "left")
        else
            play_animation(self, self.direction_y > 0 and "up" or "down")
        end
    else
        stop_movement(self)
    end
end
```

#### Zombie Smooth Movement (WORKING)
```lua
-- Zombie moves smoothly using vector math
local dx = player_pos.x - zombie_pos.x
local dy = player_pos.y - zombie_pos.y
local distance = math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)

local move_x = (dx / distance) * self.speed * dt
local move_y = (dy / distance) * self.speed * dt

zombie_pos.x = zombie_pos.x + move_x
zombie_pos.y = zombie_pos.y + move_y
go.set_position(zombie_pos)
```

#### Side-Scrolling Camera System (WORKING)
```lua
-- Camera following system in main.script
function update_camera(self)
    -- Get player position
    local player_pos = go.get_position("player")

    -- Calculate desired camera position (follow player)
    local camera_x = player_pos.x - self.screen_width / 2

    -- Clamp camera to world bounds
    camera_x = math.max(0, camera_x)  -- Don't scroll past left edge
    camera_x = math.min(self.world_width - self.screen_width, camera_x)  -- Don't scroll past right edge

    -- Update camera position
    msg.post("@render:", "set_view_projection", {
        view = vmath.matrix4_look_at(
            vmath.vector3(camera_x + self.screen_width/2, self.screen_height/2, 1),
            vmath.vector3(camera_x + self.screen_width/2, self.screen_height/2, 0),
            vmath.vector3(0, 1, 0)
        )
    })
end
```

## Status: SINGLE-SCREEN ZOMBIE ESCAPE GAME COMPLETE ✅
## Next: CONVERT TO PLATFORMER MECHANICS 🏃‍♂️

### Recent Updates (Current Session)

#### Background and Spawn Position Updates ✅
- **Background images**: Converted HEIC files to PNG and resized to 960x640 to match game screen
- **Player spawn**: Fixed to door center at coordinates (212, 55) using forced positioning in main script
- **Zombie spawn**: Fixed to far left at coordinates (50, 56) at same height as player
- **Debug system**: Added coordinate debugging to identify actual vs expected spawn positions

#### Stage Completion System ✅
- **Win condition**: Player reaches X coordinate > 937 (right edge of screen) to complete stage
- **Stage complete behavior**:
  - Stops zombie movement
  - Disables player input
  - Shows "STAGE COMPLETE!" message in console
  - Allows restart with 'R' key
- **Game states**: Now supports both win (stage complete) and lose (caught by zombie) conditions

#### Technical Fixes ✅
- **Camera system**: Removed problematic side-scrolling camera causing console errors
- **Single screen**: Converted from 1920x640 side-scrolling to 960x640 single screen gameplay
- **Position debugging**: Added debug output to track player positioning issues
- **Forced positioning**: Main script now forces correct player spawn position to override collection file issues
- **HTML5 background rendering**: Fixed background not displaying in HTML5 builds by adjusting z-depth from -1.0 to -0.1
- **Player state reset**: Fixed phantom rightward movement after restart by clearing all input/physics state on enable/disable

#### Current Game Flow ✅
1. **Start**: Player spawns at door center (212, 55), zombie at far left (50, 56)
2. **Gameplay**: Player moves to avoid zombie while heading toward right edge
3. **Win**: Reach X > 937 for "STAGE COMPLETE!" message
4. **Lose**: Get caught by zombie (within 30 pixels) for "GAME OVER!" message
5. **Restart**: Press 'R' from either win or lose state to restart
